# Coffee Shop

## Prompt
You’ve been hired as a developer for a new coffee shop. Your job is to debug the CoffeeShop program and add logging to ensure all operations run smoothly and match the expected output.

1. Run the `simulation.rb` file and fix the syntax errors.
2. Strategically add puts statements to `coffee_shop.rb`:
   - Log the size and type of coffee ordered (e.g., `📖 Placed order for a Medium Latte`)
   - Log when an order is fulfilled (e.g., `✅ Fulfilled order for Medium Latte`)
   - Log when an order cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient supplies (e.g., `❌ Insufficient supplies for Small Espresso`)
   - Log when all orders are complete (e.g., `🏁 There are 0 orders remaining!`)

Expected Output:

```bash
☕ Welcome to Java Haven!
📖 Placed order for a Medium Latte
📖 Placed order for a Large Cappuccino
📖 Placed order for a Small Espresso
🔄 Fulfilling orders...
✅ Fulfilled order for Medium Latte
✅ Fulfilled order for Large Cappuccino
❌ Insufficient supplies for Small Espresso
🏁 There are 0 orders remaining!
```

Remember to ask questions and talk through your thought process. We are here to help. 😄
